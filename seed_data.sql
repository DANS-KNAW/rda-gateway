Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) are rapidly becoming important tools for data capture across many Scientific domains, as well as within commercial industry.  sUAS have the potential to transform how data are captured in many arenas by, offering higher temporal and spatial resolutions, with less impact on the environments being monitored, and access to new locations and parameters.  In many cases these advantages are further accompanied by lowered costs and increased human safety during data capture.   
 
As a new technology, however, there are currently no industry-wide accepted best practices for sUAS sensor and flight data handling and management.  There are many reasons for why such would be beneficial but 3 of particular note include: 

The creation of standards would lower the barrier to entry and  innovation in terms of what might be monitored with sUAS, by reducing the number of unknowns a new user faces and providing working examples to serve as guides.
With no common goal standards to build to, the development of mature tools for sUAS captured data processing and fusion (with sUAS and other data sources) is currently hampered.  As a consequence, each use case generally develops a unique custom pipeline that only sees one-time use.  
sUAS captured data is &#8211; for the most part &#8211; not being managed according to data stewardship best practices, such as would ensure the data is FAIR, as articulated by Force11 (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable).   

This interest group therefore seeks to explore and publish (via the RDA community based model), some best practices as regards the handling of sUAS captured sensor and flight data.  By publishing such, after a broad, cross-community engagement process, it is hoped and expected that such will see adoption by both those already using sUAS for scientific work those just beginning to explore their possibilities.  They will therefore address the 3 concerns laid out above, with the associated positive consequences for the scientific community. These outcomes also align directly with the RDA’s Vision and Mission focus, namely, promoting the open sharing of data.

For example, the relationships among SDGs 13, 14 & 15 on human livelihood, reflected by SDGs 1 through 7, are particularly intriguing and modelling their dynamics can provide answers to general questions in the form of What Works Across Countries and Sectors? The relationships among attributes describe the invariant conditions that epitomise the meaningfulness of the concept which DSF learns from available data. DSF adopts first principles approach, treating SDGs as sub-projects, driven by the well-documented relationship between knowledge & development in time and space. It focuses on trust, interdisciplinarity, authoritative data, knowledge transfer, resources, tools & techniques. Analogous to Eleanor Roosevelt’s view on where universal rights begin, it takes a bottom-up approach to the universal agenda 2030, seeking real knowledge on indicators from "...small places, close to home–so close and so small that they cannot be seen on" the World Bank SDG Atlas. Its main objectives are therefore to map and deliver knowledge about clusters of individual societies on that global map, their disparate neighborhoods, activities, achievements and influencing factors, based on indicators deriving from relevant and authoritative data from various sources, including grey literature and citizen science. Its implementation strategy is for three pilot DSF SDG monitoring nodes to be established in three African countries with known socio-economic heterogeneity, in order to provide a clear baseline for the project.

Working Group:
The conflicting goals of protecting and maintaining control over sensitive data, confidential data or data protected by intellectual property rights, while striving to give third parties access to the data, pose a significant challenge. Trusted Research Environments (TREs), also referred to as Secure Research Environments (SREs), have been established in the last decade that, when properly set-up and operated, help ease this problem by providing high security guarantees of a highly controlled and monitored environment.
The Working Group on Trusted Research Environments for Sensitive Data (WG-TRESD) seeks to produce a better understanding of the elements making up TREs (and their different extensions, flavors, etc.) and the processes running in and supported by them, bridging terminology boundaries to ease the set-up and operations of, and the co-operation and interoperability between, such infrastructures, enabling FAIR access and use of data in such restricted settings.
Following the TRE Green Paper requirements we consider systems where users are presented with a remote desktop where they can run analysis on confidential data (applying algorithms to datasets exploratively). With this working definition, we do not consider job-submission systems like Blind SANE who apply (approved) algorithms to sensitive/confidential data a full TRE, while such components may form part of the tooling environment for specific types of interaction. We found that many SREs/TREs are similar in architecture design and technical implementation. There is, however, a lack of openly available guidelines and explanations on design decisions for setting up and running a SRE/TRE, including technical implementation of roles and their permissions, ingesting data, processing data, exporting data, provision of virtual machines/compute units, isolation, privacy-preserving techniques, etc. This deficiency comes to light especially when planning towards federation across SREs/TREs to connect infrastructure providers with shared interfaces, bilateral trust and shared resources or data, due to the lack of standards.
In this working group we will identify common concepts that SREs/TREs implement in different flavors, suggest common interfaces between those concepts and communicate them to the public.

This API will provide a unified approach to accessing and managing information within maDMPs, ensuring interoperability across different tools and systems. Notably, the API specification will be independent of any specific programming language or platform, representing a community consensus on how maDMP data should be accessed and exchanged.
Currently, DMP tools vary in how they implement the RDA Recommendation on maDMPs [1]. This recommendation establishes a consensus on representing DMP information in a machine-actionable way, primarily supporting cases where maDMPs are transferred as complete entities between services—similar to how traditional DMPs are exchanged as documents. However, to fully leverage the transition from static PDFs to maDMPs, we must enable more granular access—both for reading and writing—of maDMP information. It is essential to move beyond the paradigm of simply generating and transmitting documents. By creating a common API for maDMPs, we will facilitate the evolution of DMP tools into DMP platforms that integrate more seamlessly with other services where research data is processed. This will also allow them to function as dashboards, providing real-time insights into data management, such as where research data is stored, who has access, and where it will be published.
This WG brings together a global network of experts in data management planning, building on the Salzburg Manifesto [2]—a joint declaration from leading DMP tool providers in Europe, the US, and the UK. The manifesto underscores the urgent need for a standardized API to support machine-actionable DMPs, aligning with the WG’s goal of fostering collaboration and harmonization across regions. The initiative was presented at the RDA Plenary in Costa Rica, where it received strong support from maDMP adopters, reinforcing its significance.
Implementing this API will transform maDMPs into dynamic, continuously updated records. For instance, they could automatically incorporate real-time data from external services, such as repository updates when datasets are deposited. Additionally, Scientific Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) could use the API to retrieve relevant data from finalized DMPs. By structuring and automating access to maDMP data, the API will enhance Research Data Management (RDM) assessment and improve research evaluation mechanisms.
More broadly, this API will enhance the communication of scientific information by making research data more transparent and accessible. This increased transparency will strengthen public trust in science and encourage greater societal engagement with research outcomes.
Some preliminary work has already been carried out to support this WG. The OSTrails project has contributed to this effort, and its deliverable D1.4 outlines key ideas and potential next steps for API development [3]. Additionally, a journal paper [4] has been published, further exploring the challenges and opportunities associated with standardizing access to maDMPs. These resources provide a solid foundation for the WG&#8217;s activities and will help guide discussions and implementation efforts.

In recent years, data stewards and data stewardship have received increasing attention as the key to achieving effective research data management and FAIR data. Projects and initiatives at both national and international levels have examined the tasks and roles of data stewards, defined job profiles for data stewards, considered skills, competences and training of data stewards, and developed training and certificate courses for data stewards. Within the RDA, the Professionalising Data Stewardship IG – endorsed in 2020 – has considered the landscape of data stewardship education and training as well as surveyed, at the global level, the organisational context and models for data stewardship service provision and individual data steward career tracks.
Current understanding of data steward career tracks focuses largely on defining various data steward roles (e.g., generic vs. embedded data stewards or research vs. policy vs. infrastructure focused data stewards) as well as the skills and training data stewards need to  perform these roles successfully. There is very limited attention in current literature and project-based efforts to define sustainable, long-term data steward career paths. The career tracks survey by the RDA PDS IG provides some initial insights on the medium to long-term professional perspectives of data stewards, but it represents respondents’ self-assessment of career prospects and underscores the need for further systematic work on data steward career tracks.
Both the RDA PDS IG career tracks survey report and the Dutch roadmap towards national implementation of FAIR data stewardship highlight that “the lack of a clear career path makes it difficult to recruit and retain talented data stewardship professionals.” Uncertainty about professional possibilities and career advancement, lack of clearly-defined career trajectories, limited mapping of data steward roles onto established professional roles and career paths means that even though in recent years we have developed in-depth knowledge about the training, skills, and education of prospective data stewards as well as about the professional roles and functions of data stewards, we still have a very limited understanding and lack tools to define how data stewards progress in their careers once they have become data stewards, how they move from entry-level to mid-career and senior level data steward positions, and the availability of such positions, what they entail and how they relate to one another. Without a clearer, more systematic understanding of data steward career tracks, we cannot achieve the professionalisation of data stewardship.
The RDA Data Steward Career Tracks WG proposes to approach data steward career tracks systematically by developing a methodology for data steward persona definition and creating a sample of data steward personas as well as career pathways for the sample personas.
A methodology for data steward persona development, a repository of sample personas and a career track for sample personas have the potential for both medium-term outcomes and long-term impacts by giving visibility to data steward career tracks and offering tools that can be adopted and adapted to specific service contexts. This will allow service owners and institutional management at various levels a resource (the methodology) to develop sustainable, formalised job profiles and long-term career tracks for data stewards as part of their service development as well as provide their data stewards with appropriate continued professional development and growth opportunities. Potential and current data stewards, on the other hand, can use the repository of sample personas to understand better potential career paths and to plan their own careers by seeking out relevant professional development and growth opportunities. We expect a long-term impact of service sustainability, better recognition of data stewards as professionals with defined career paths, and higher retention of qualified professionals in data steward roles.

Enhanced tool characterization through standardized attributes assessment
Sustainable governance and maintenance mechanisms
Development of use cases
Integration with complementary frameworks, particularly the GORC International Model

Researchers seeking appropriate tools for their workflows
Infrastructure developers building research commons and clouds
Organizations working to improve research tool interoperability
The broader research community striving for FAIR and open science practices

The FAIR Mappings WG aims at working with the various communities and the RDA WGs which have generated mappings to converge toward common guidelines to make different types of mappings FAIR, and a common machine-readable/actionable set of representations of the mappings beyond the capabilities of the current existing specifications.
The WG will create a unifying classification of mappings that builds on existing classifications such as RDA Brokering Framework and Semantic Mapping Vocabulary (SEMAPV). The development of this ontology/classification will be done using concrete case-studies collected from the involved communities. By building this classification, the WG will ensure that the FAIR guidelines and the set of exchange models cover the scope of mapping diversity and that any further developments and discussions can happen using more precise mapping related terminology. Finally, these outputs will be used to create an open knowledge base of mapping and crosswalk scenarios with rich metadata which could be leveraged by communities to complement the provided guidelines when starting their mapping journey. This work will be done in close collaboration with existing projects in the EOSC context such as FAIR-IMPACT, which is developing guidelines and capturing community mapping activities, and FAIRCORE4EOSC, which is developing resources to register mappings, with the RDA providing them with the mechanism for engaging stakeholders beyond Europe.
The WG will create value by bringing together and harmonising efforts in other RDA WGs which work on generating mappings or are considering creating mappings (e.g., Metadata IG, Scientific Knowledge Graphs &#8211; Interoperability Framework (SKG-IF) WG, FAIRsharing WG, Harmonised terminologies and schemas for FAIR data in materials science and related domains WG, I-ADOPT WG, FAIRification of Genomic Annotations WG, and the Brokering Framework WG) and by working towards a common exchange model for sharing of FAIR crosswalks covering the diverse needs of different disciplines. In addition to the valorisation of existing RDA WG outputs, the WG will also collaborate with international organisations such as CODATA and the UN to ensure the uptake of the RDA Working Group outputs.

Health data commons (HDCs) are the health-data-focused versions of data commons, which bring together health data infrastructures. HDCs have been or are being launched across a number of geographies to enable the reuse of participant-level health data at the national and cross-national levels. HDCs will enable machine learning and related artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches to health data analysis and support the national and cross-national detection and response to epidemics. HDCs can facilitate public health surveillance, observational clinical research, personalized medicine, and the design and conduct of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by enabling country- and cross-country or global analyses of health data. Whether and how the FAIR principles are implemented affects how metadata and participant-level data can be reused across HDCs. FAIR convergence, as when related stakeholders take the same or similar routes to implementing FAIR, can help foster interoperability in the health data space where there are many standards for the capture or exchange of health data and for which there are limited crosswalks that link ontologies. Open collaboration on FAIR implementation also helps stakeholders reuse available resources and standards rather than developing new ones. 
Through this WG, we aim to bring together HDCs in all stages of planning or implementation to:

identify what items in the GORC international model (IM) are relevant for country-level or transnational HDCs;
identify additional metadata needed to understand different levels of interoperability and address sensitive data concerns (e.g., access conditions, data governance, benefit sharing) relevant to HDCs and not addressed in the GORC IM; 
semantify the HDC GORC profile metadata;
collect agreed-upon metadata from the HDC GORC profile to understand how HDCs are being implemented;
produce a knowledge graph showing how different HDCs relate to one another and other types of Data Commons. 

The HDC metadata schema from this WG will support semantic and technical interoperability between HDCs and support FAIR HDCs, where health data has maximum citability, reusability, and interpretability while addressing local policy, ethics, and security concerns. The HDC GORC profile WG implementation profile and knowledge graph will also support the implementation map of the GORC model more generally and identify where and how organizations are currently addressing aspects of FAIR, where the gaps are, and the tools to address the gaps. 
The intent of this WG is not to solve FAIR for health or to provide best practice for implementing HDCs. Instead, we would like to support community development of FAIR metadata that HDCs and related stakeholders can use to understand what implementation decisions have been made by other HDCs or commons in other domains and to share their HDCs’ implementation decisions. Rather than being prescriptive, these metadata can identify gaps in cross-commons interoperability or the coverage of other global issues in the HDC space (e.g., indigenous health data sovereignty) and opportunities for semantic and technical interoperability with commons in other spaces (e.g., climate data, environmental exposures data, biodiversity data, oceans data).

While having these data are essential, the fact that some of these data are of a sensitive nature, and the fact that power imbalances in agri-food value chains affect the way these data flows and who benefits the most, have strong ethical consequences.

The WG will address the ethical issues related to the treatment of agricultural data, focusing especially on the challenges and risks for the most marginalized actors in the data value chains: smallholder farmers and indigenous people. These groups are expected or asked to contribute data and be transparent, but have no voice in how data are used and are not the beneficiaries of the data revolution and digital transformation in general to which they contribute.

Addressing these issues requires moving from the abstract philosophical level to the practical level: producing/assembling sets of actionable guidelines for different actors on how to treat agricultural data ethically, respecting the rights of all parties involved and in particular those of the weaker actors, so that the benefits are equally shared.
Mission The Ethics in Ag Data WG strives to establish actionable guidelines for the ethical collection, use, processing, and sharing of agricultural data.
Vision To convene experts from diverse fields, interest groups and regions to co-develop, exchange, and endorse adaptable ethical guidelines for agricultural data across diverse contexts.

The working group will focus on three aspects of extension:

Firstly, many generalist repositories cannot currently be certified by any of the existing authorities &#8211; with typical impediments often involving specialised curation and appraisal capabilities, lack of long-term preservation services, repository sustainability, and the cost and burden of paperwork associated with the certification process. Some repositories will adequately provide some elements of what can be expected of a trustworthy repository, and it is in the interest of the community to be informed about the status of the repositories for these elements (e.g., criteria-level modular certification).
Secondly, some elements of service &#8211; especially long-term preservation &#8211; can be outsourced, and there are benefits to this &#8211; economy of scale being an obvious one. Repositories seeking certification at present have to certify such services individually for each application event. It is more efficient to certify the service and for repositories using such a service to reference such a certification.
Thirdly, the level of performance expected by certification authorities sets the bar at a high level of maturity, and this results in an inability to recognise and encourage repositories that are in a process of improving performance. The community has no information on the status of repositories’ work towards these criteria since the certification processes are binary and encompassing (i.e., all included criteria must be met). Repository funders, journals, and researchers interested in depositing or reusing data will benefit from mechanisms that publicise performance assessment at the criteria level even though certification is considered or in process. This consideration requires careful balancing: on the one hand, it is clearly beneficial to know more about non-certified repositories and services, but one also has to retain the driving force towards formal certification. Metadata-driven criteria-level modular performance assessments can also reduce the cost of certification and the time between repository actions and certification of those actions.

The main outcomes expected for the working group are the following:

Through community consultation and a scoping review, compile an inventory of performance expectations for repositories and related services, and map these to the portfolio of existing criteria applied by the certification authorities. We will use this mapping in combination with stakeholder consultations to verify importance to the community, and to identify gaps. The current portfolio of criteria for all authorities are based on OAIS-RM. There may be additional criteria that are important &#8211; e.g., expected by CARE, privacy concerns, and reproducibility &#8211; that are also worth evaluating in the same process.
Based on community input and scoping review, develop a conceptual model of the actors and service providers in the ecosystem.
Within the same community consultation process, determine the formal and informal criteria whereby an appropriate repository or service is typically selected by stakeholders in their context (e.g., scientific discipline, institutional affiliation, country, data formats, etc.).
Through a process of community engagement, determine which of the selected criteria should apply to generalist repositories, to services, other actors, and what level of performance can be expected of different actors in the ecosystem.
Determine, through stakeholder consultation, priorities for criteria implementation and identify metadata that can be associated with the implementation of each criteria to facilitate modular, decentralized certification.

The working group recognises, but specifically excludes, similar needs associated with other research outputs (e.g., code, semantic artefacts, etc.), while recognising that these outputs need to be considered when developing recommendations &#8211; so as to maximise the reusability of criteria and levels of performance for other outputs. The working group will publish a set of modular trustworthiness performance expectations for data repositories and related services (recommendations), and supplementary materials derived from the scoping review and community consultation.
This group will build on related work done in multiple contexts. Specifically, we will consider the work of several groups who have developed schema for classifying “trust” in repositories, such as CoreTrustSeal, Nestor, POSI, and ISO. This list will be further extended through the landscape analysis. We have begun to accumulate internationally recognized certification criteria and related outputs from RDA and the international community to review in a Zotero library.

Because the immune system plays an important role in such a wide range of diseases and health conditions, from fighting pathogens to autoimmune disorders, digital twins of the immune system (IDTs) will have an especially high impact. However, their development presents major challenges, stemming from the inherent complexity of the immune system and the difficulty of measuring many aspects of a patient’s immune state in vivo. A collaborative interdisciplinary effort involving immunologists, clinicians, mathematical modelers, and software engineers is required to achieve substantial progress.
