Identifiers,"The persistence of the identity of digital objects and stability of references to those objects are essential to sustaining a trusted distributed research ecosystem that supports verifiable and reusable research."
Metadata and ontologies,"An overarching, coordinated approach is required, forming the basis for interoperability"
FAIR metrics and certification,"Existing work on FAIR metrics and certification should be extended to ensure applicability across disciplines and support their implementation. FAIR assessments must be inclusive and progressive, and take the specific research context and needs into account."
Authentication and authorisation infrastructure,"The purpose of AAI in EOSC is to allow identified scientists to (re)use identifiable documents, data and software, and exploit identified services, while enabling high-trust collaborations to be established and maintained with little or no friction to the end user. The goal is to build a foundation for AAI that will ensure long-term availability of the aspects of digital identity that are unique to scientific collaborations."
User environments,"Throughout the distributed, federated and clustered architecture of the EOSC ecosystem, the user environments must meet the users' requirements and expectations, particularly with regard to discovery and composability of resources."
Resource provider environments,"As a federation built out of many independent organisations and resource providers - a system of systems - EOSC should be inclusive rather than selective. The added value of EOSC exists only when as many as possible of the resource providers serving the scientific community can enter and offer resources"
EOSC Interoperability Framework,"Achieving a good level of technical, semantic, organisational and legal interoperability within EOSC is essential to federate services and provide added value for users, across disciplines, countries and sectors."
